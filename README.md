We have implemented all the basic functionality. We tried to add an Autocomplete feature for the 
search bar, but we were unable to implement it fully within the timeline. We also had an issue of 
images constantly flickering when scrolling the ListView in the NewsListActivity. As a result, we 
removed the thumbnail image from the ListView as it was not part of the requirement.
